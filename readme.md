# Dream.mf Remote Orchestration Services

## Overview

Dream.mf Remote Orchestration Services is a microservice designed to facilitate frontend applications that utilize Module Federation technology. It centralizes configuration, host and remote details, versions, files, and relationships within the product. The service acts as a proxy, storing files in either Azure Blob Storage or AWS S3 buckets.

## Features
- **Centralized Configuration**: Host all configuration details for Module Federation in one place.
- **Proxy Service**: Acts as a proxy for storing files in Azure Blob Storage or AWS S3.
- **Version Control**: Manage different versions of files and configurations.
- **Relationship Management**: Maintain relationships between different modules and services.
